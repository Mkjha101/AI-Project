## Main requirements file (keeps only lightweight / cross-platform packages).
# This file is safe to install on most Windows/Python setups for development.
# Heavy ML libraries (torch, torchvision, tensorflow, ultralytics, transformers, etc.)
# are intentionally NOT included here because they often require specific Python
# versions, system libs or conda for reliable installation. Use `requirements-full.txt`
# or conda for the full ML stack.
